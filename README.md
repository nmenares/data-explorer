## What is the Positive Disruption Data Explorer?
The Positive Disruption model examines low- and no-carbon technologies and practices in the energy, agriculture, and land-use sectors, modeling how adoption of these technologies and practices can be expected to grow over the next 30 years, and the effect they will have on the process of reversing climate change.

The Positive Disruption Data Explorer is a web-based tool that allows for easy navigation through model results.
